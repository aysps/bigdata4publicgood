| ### The Privacy Paradox     |
+-----------------------------+

> Although a majority of people claim that privacy is important to them, few take steps to protect it online or through devices that sense location, voice, images, and other identifiable features. This module explores the reasons for this paradox and what actions policy-makers (and you) can take to protect the big data that you generate.
