| ### The Privacy Paradox |
+-------------------------+

> Although a majority of people claim that privacy is important to them, few take steps to protect it online or through devices that sense location, voice, images, and other identifiable features. This module explores the reasons for this paradox and what actions policy-makers (and you) can take to protect the big data that you generate.

## Post

Address the following in the [5.1 Data Privacy](/discussions/M5-1.qmd) discussion board:

-   one statistic from the Pew survey that you feel is most urgent to address by policy-makers. Why?

-   Describe which Privacy Paradox Challenge that you chose, what information surprised you from the podcast, and what you learned from completing the challenge at the end.

-   The *proposed* American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) from 2022 is the most recent action that Congress has taken to protect your data privacy. Describe one of the facets of the bill that you think will address the statistic you cited from the Pew survey and how it will work. Also discuss how it may fall short.

Discussion posts are the primary assessment of your understanding and critical assessment of readings. You must reference the readings analyzed in your posts using in-text APA style. Posts should range between 400-500 words.
