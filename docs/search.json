    "text": "Overview\nPublic and nonprofit agencies are beginning to unlock the potential of large-scale data to improve service delivery and inform policy. Computational tools capable of making productive use of big data have proliferated in recent years, drastically decreasing the barriers to entry for these applications. This course explores the practice of using data to improve decision-making and evaluation, including techniques for data collection, analysis, and behavior change. You will learn about the opportunities and challenges of big data and devise a plan to apply them to areas of personal interest within the public sector.\n\n\n\nCourse Goal & Objectives\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\n\nDefine big data and describe its characteristics;\nDiscuss how public agencies harness large-scale data to inform policy design, increase stakeholder engagement, and improve service delivery.\nRecognize situations when it’s possible to collect data to inform evidenced-based policy decision-making;\nIntelligently consider the social, political, and ethical considerations of using big data and its analytical techniques for public uses.\n\n\n\nHelpful Notes from Your Professor\n\nComplete all readings and watch the videos. They compliment each other, so both are critical to understanding course materials\nDon’t hesitate to contact me with questions or problems at any point during the semester. I will always try to respond to e-mails quickly.\nThe topics in this class are in the news all the time. Don’t hesitate to send me or post articles or videos related to course material.\n\n\n\nRequired Book\nNo books are required for this course. All learning materials are available through the course site.\n\n\nContact Information\nProfessor A Phone: (000) 123-4567 Email: Please contact Dr. Cynthia Searcy at csearcy@gsu.edu for question regarding this open course Office hour: by appointment"

    "text": "This lab introduces you to two data-driven models of neighborhood change. We will use this case study over the semester to discuss things like data needs for predictive models. You will be required to think critically about the data used in the labs, but you will not be responsible for things like the advanced analytical models in the paper. I am approaching the labs with the assumption that you are likely to be new analysts or a manager hiring an analyst, so you just need a high-level understanding of the models in order to participate in the task.\nNeighborhood change is a complicated concept with a lot of loaded terminology. We might think about neighborhoods that are “revitalized”, “gentrified”, that are “stable”, or that “decline”. We could spend an entire semester unpacking all of these constructs, but that is out of scope of the lab. Here we are more interested in how we might make sense of our data, and then once we have meaningful groups how we might use them to make predictions with the data. Can a city forecast how its current neighborhoods are likely to change over the next decade, and can that help with urban planning processes?\nRead the following articles:\n\nGoldstein, I. Market Value Analysis: A Data-Based Approach to Understanding Urban Housing Markets in Board of Governors, Federal Reserve Systems, Putting Data to Work: Data-Driven Approaches to Strengthening Neighborhoods. 2011. pp 49-59\nDelmelle, E. C. (2017). Differentiating pathways of neighborhood change in 50 US metropolitan areas. Environment and planning A, 49(10), 2402-2424.\n\nWe are interested in understanding neighborhood change. These data-driven approaches to the phenomenon use machine-learning algorithms to “discover” coherent communities within the city by grouping census tracks into groups that minimize within-group differences and maximize between-group differences.\nYou can explore one of these algorithms by looking at examples of how botanists might create “species” based upon characteristics of flowers:\nClustering Example\nA data-driven approach to understanding neighborhood change requires us to (1) define “neighborhoods”, or groups of census tracks in the data that are very similar, and (2) use those group characteristics at a point in time to predict how the “neighborhood” might change in the future. Both of the papers present variations on Step (1) above.\nRead the two papers linked on iCollege, then answer the following questions:\n\nHow did each author identify coherent “neighborhoods” (or groups) in each model?\nWould these “neighborhoods” line up with neighborhoods that are defined on a city’s zoning maps?\nDid the two models use the same data to create the groups?\nHow do the labels and descriptions of the groups differ in each model and why?\n\nWrite your responses in a word document and name your file LAB-01-YOUR-LAST-NAME, then submit it via the iCollege assignment folder. Concise and precise answers are preferred to meandering paragraphs! One page would be fine for this assignment.\nConcise and precise answers are preferred to meandering paragraphs!

This assignment requires that you identify a research question and develop a plan to complete workshops over the semester that will expose you to the data science knowledge and skills needed to develop a big data project. By the end of the semester, you’ll submit a proposal that describes how you can answer the research question using big data and data science techniques.\nYou will turn in this plan as your “discussion” this week. But don’t wait until class day to start this assignment. Formulating a good research question takes time, and if you’re struggling with how to use big data in a project that interests you then you need to give me time to help you. Reach out by email to set up a time to talk or post questions to the Class Q & A discussion board. \n\nDownload the instructions for the data certification plan.\nIf you need some inspiration, check out this web blog. Or Google “big data and X (your field).” It’s also a good idea to look at some academic journals in your field to see how the techniques of data science are being applied. \nWrite me an email or set up a time to talk if you need help.\nSubmit your data certification plan to the “1.3 Data Certification” assignment folder.\n\nDue by: 11/24 at 11:59pm",

Since it’s early in the semester, what you propose to do in this plan may change as you learn more about big data and its applications to your interests. However, I’m requiring that you submit this plan now so that I can learn what topics you’re interested in and how the data certification will enhance your data skills.\nGSU provides multiple opportunities for learning data skills and tools.

Be aware that some platforms offer free access to courses, but earning a badge/certificate comes with a fee.\nYou may not use trainings or modules that you complete for other courses that you’re taking this semester.

It’s an opportunity to invest in data skills that you think will be important to your future work.\nDue to the variety of data workshops and free data courses, it’s impossible for me to know what will interest you or their formats. If you have a question about the suitability of a workshop or course for this assignment, please contact me well before the deadline of this plan.\nAfter I review and approve your data certification plan, you will be required to submit a short report after each workshop to identify what you learned, how you’ll use the new skills in your project proposal (or elsewhere), and whether you recommend the workshop to other students.

If you’re undecided at this point in the semester what question you’ll propose to answer, describe ones that cluster around the same topic for this assignment.\nFor example, I’m interested in understanding the relationship between needle aversion and COVID vaccination rates. I think that the language and imagery used to encourage vaccination is having the opposite effect. Nearly every advertisement or news segment about COVID vaccination shows a needle going in an arm (up close!) and uses language like “get the shot” or “jab,” which evokes negative feelings in most people (e.g., like going to the dentist or booster shots as a child). For those who also have fears that the vaccination is risky, these images and words reduce the likelihood that they’ll get a vaccine. I hypothesize that the ubiquity and volume of this imagery on TV and social media (big data) is reinforcing needle aversion to an extent that it’s driving down vaccination rates. So, my research question is “Has intense exposure to imagery and language of needles decreased COVID vaccination rates in the United States?” If a relationship exists, removing needle imagery and language from mass media could improve vaccination compliance and lower the threat of COVID to public health."

Whether you plan to be a data scientist or work with a team of them, you need to understand how big data are collected, analyzed, and communicated. This module starts with an overview of data science to learn the steps in the life cycle of a big data project. It ends with you developing a plan to earn a data certification that exposes you to the tools and techniques of stages in the data science life cycle that fit your skill needs."

This assignment requires that you identify a research question and develop a plan to complete workshops over the semester that will expose you to the data science knowledge and skills needed to develop a big data project. By the end of the semester, you’ll submit a proposal that describes how you can answer the research question using big data and data science techniques.\nYou will turn in this plan as your “discussion” this week. But don’t wait until class day to start this assignment. Formulating a good research question takes time, and if you’re struggling with how to use big data in a project that interests you then you need to give me time to help you. Reach out by email to set up a time to talk or post questions to the Class Q & A discussion board. \n\nDownload the instructions for the data certification plan.\nIf you need some inspiration, check out this web blog. Or Google “big data and X (your field).” It’s also a good idea to look at some academic journals in your field to see how the techniques of data science are being applied. \nWrite me an email or set up a time to talk if you need help.\nSubmit your data certification plan to the “1.3 Data Certification” assignment folder.\n\nDue by: 11/24 at 11:59pm"
