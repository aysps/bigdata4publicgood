    "text": "Overview\nPublic and nonprofit agencies are beginning to unlock the potential of large-scale data to improve service delivery and inform policy. Computational tools capable of making productive use of big data have proliferated in recent years, drastically decreasing the barriers to entry for these applications. This course explores the practice of using data to improve decision-making and evaluation, including techniques for data collection, analysis, and behavior change. You will learn about the opportunities and challenges of big data and devise a plan to apply them to areas of personal interest within the public sector. \n\n\nCourse Goal & Objectives\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\n\nDefine big data and describe its characteristics;\nDiscuss how public agencies harness large-scale data to inform policy design, increase stakeholder engagement, and improve service delivery.\nRecognize situations when it’s possible to collect data to inform evidenced-based policy decision-making;\nIntelligently consider the social, political, and ethical considerations of using big data and its analytical techniques for public uses.\n\n\n\nHelpful Notes from Your Professor\n\nComplete all readings and watch the videos. They compliment each other, so both are critical to understanding course materials\nDon’t hesitate to contact me with questions or problems at any point during the semester. I will always try to respond to e-mails quickly.\nThe topics in this class are in the news all the time. Don’t hesitate to send me or post articles or videos related to course material.\n\n\n\nRequired Book\nNo books are required for this course. All learning materials are available through the course site.\n\n\nContact Information\nProfessor A\nPhone: (000) 123-4567\nEmail: Please contact Dr. Cynthia Searcy for question regarding this open course\ncsearcy@gsu.edu\nOffice hour:"
