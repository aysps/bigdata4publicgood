    "text": "This lab introduces you to two data-driven models of neighborhood change. We will use this case study over the semester to discuss things like data needs for predictive models. You will be required to think critically about the data used in the labs, but you will not be responsible for things like the advanced analytical models in the paper. I am approaching the labs with the assumption that you are likely to be new analysts or a manager hiring an analyst, so you just need a high-level understanding of the models in order to participate in the task.\nNeighborhood change is a complicated concept with a lot of loaded terminology. We might think about neighborhoods that are “revitalized”, “gentrified”, that are “stable”, or that “decline”. We could spend an entire semester unpacking all of these constructs, but that is out of scope of the lab. Here we are more interested in how we might make sense of our data, and then once we have meaningful groups how we might use them to make predictions with the data. Can a city forecast how its current neighborhoods are likely to change over the next decade, and can that help with urban planning processes?\nRead the following articles:\n\nGoldstein, I. Market Value Analysis: A Data-Based Approach to Understanding Urban Housing Markets in Board of Governors, Federal Reserve Systems, Putting Data to Work: Data-Driven Approaches to Strengthening Neighborhoods. 2011. pp 49-59\nDelmelle, E. C. (2017). Differentiating pathways of neighborhood change in 50 US metropolitan areas. Environment and planning A, 49(10), 2402-2424.\n\nWe are interested in understanding neighborhood change. These data-driven approaches to the phenomenon use machine-learning algorithms to “discover” coherent communities within the city by grouping census tracks into groups that minimize within-group differences and maximize between-group differences.\nYou can explore one of these algorithms by looking at examples of how botanists might create “species” based upon characteristics of flowers:\nClustering Example\nA data-driven approach to understanding neighborhood change requires us to (1) define “neighborhoods”, or groups of census tracks in the data that are very similar, and (2) use those group characteristics at a point in time to predict how the “neighborhood” might change in the future. Both of the papers present variations on Step (1) above.\nRead the two papers linked on iCollege, then answer the following questions:\n\nHow did each author identify coherent “neighborhoods” (or groups) in each model?\nWould these “neighborhoods” line up with neighborhoods that are defined on a city’s zoning maps?\nDid the two models use the same data to create the groups?\nHow do the labels and descriptions of the groups differ in each model and why?\n\nWrite your responses in a word document and name your file LAB-01-YOUR-LAST-NAME, then submit it via the iCollege assignment folder.

    "text": "Instructions\nIn the first lab we examined two articles (Goldstein, 2019; Delmelle, 2017) where machine learn models were used to identify neighborhood “types” in cities.\nThe authors explained how each type tended to change in different ways over time, so understanding what category or stage a neighborhood belongs to helps the city understand what types of change might be eminent.\nIf you read about the methodologies in both articles, you will see that the advanced machine learning methods they apply are not doing anything more complicated than what many indices developed for well-being or consumer prices do – combine different variables and assign probabilities to each to measure an underlying or latent social construct. The main advantage that a computer has in this process is the ability to try every combination of variables to find the optimal way(s) to group them to create distinct dimensions of the construct you want to measure. Once the computers identify the stable groups, it is up to the human to come up with meaningful titles for each and determine if the groups actually tell us anything useful about the world (just like we would like to know if happiness scores tell us something useful).\nUnderstanding the process of how indices are developed is a stepping stone to using predictive analytics to prescribe outcomes to social or organization phenomena. The hardest part is identifying the right types of data to collect and ensuring they are high quality. You can always hire data scientists to build the models once your organization has begun collecting meaningful data.\nIn the previous lab you read about a set of variables used in a model, so you did not have to think very hard about where that data came from and why they were selected. This lab challenges you to break open the black box and think about the process of identifying data to collect for a project. How do you know which variables are useful? How do you know what data is needed to predict success or some other outcome?\nThe short answer is you don’t, not if you are starting a new project. This lab is about “feature selection” - the process of identifying the data you will need for your project.\nStart by listening to this story about the birth and evolution of a large-scale data-driven social program. Pay particular attention to how the researchers figured out what data they needed for the program.\n“Data is like vegetables. It needs to be fresh, and it needs to be local.”\nHow Iceland Saved Its Teens (23:30)\nHow long did it take Iceland to develop its survey for youth? Did they know what they were looking for when they started?\nFeature Selection\nIf we want to use predictive analytics for a problem, we need to identify the data that is best suited for predicting the outcome. At the beginning of most projects, however, we rarely know which factors will be the biggest drivers of outcomes.\nFor example, which school characteristics best predict student performance? Is it the facilities and technology? The level of funding? Classroom sizes? Training and support provided to teachers? Parent involvement? Peer networks? All of these are plausible drivers of student performance – the most important factors are rarely self-evident in advance of having data to test them all.\n“Feature selection” is data science speak for generating a set of hypotheses and measures about what generates the outcome of interest. In many cases, feature selection is an iterative process of generating hypotheses then determining how to find or collect data to test them.\nFeature selection requires critical thinking and creativity more than technical expertise, but is a core component of any successful data science project.\nLab Takeaway: Most data architects and engineers will not be domain or subject matter experts, so they are not always good at identifying useful features. The best approach is often to assemble people close to the problem, brainstorm a large list of features, collect test data, and see what is working before you encode your data collection process for a large project or organizational need. More learning occurs during this phase of the project than any other.\nPART 1: Predicting Divorce in 3 Minutes\nThe following excerpt from Malcolm Gladwell’s book Blink describes the work of John Gottman, one of the world’s foremost experts on predictors of divorce in marriage. Unlike many scholars that study marriage and divorce in the academic field of counseling, Gottman did not approach the problem using traditional psychological theories and counseling tools. Instead he brought a data-driven approach to the subject and meticulously developed models to predict whether relationships would last or would end in divorce.\nSince the 1980s, Gottman has brought more than three thousand married couples—just like Bill and Sue— into that small room in his “love lab” near the University of Washington campus. Each couple has been videotaped, and the results have been analyzed according to something Gottman dubbed SPAFF (for specific affect), a coding system that has twenty separate categories corresponding to every conceivable emotion that a married couple might express during a conversation. Disgust, for example, is 1, contempt is 2, anger is 7, defensiveness is 10, whining is 11, sadness is 12, stonewalling is 13, neutral is 14, and so on.\nGottman has taught his staff how to read every emotional nuance in people’s facial expressions and how to interpret seemingly ambiguous bits of dialogue. When they watch a marriage videotape, they assign a SPAFF code to every second of the couple’s interaction, so that a fifteen-minute conflict discussion ends up being translated into a row of eighteen hundred numbers—nine hundred for the husband and nine hundred for the wife. The notation “7, 7, 14, 10, 11, 11,” for instance, means that in one six-second stretch, one member of the couple was briefly angry, then neutral, had a moment of defensiveness, and then began whining. Then the data from the electrodes and sensors is factored in, so that the coders know, for example, when the husband’s or the wife’s heart was pounding or when his or her temperature was rising or when either of them was jiggling in his or her seat, and all of that information is fed into a complex equation.\nOn the basis of those calculations, Gottman has proven something remarkable. If he analyzes an hour of a husband and wife talking, he can predict with 95 percent accuracy whether that couple will still be married fifteen years later. If he watches a couple for fifteen minutes, his success rate is around 90 percent.\nRecently, a professor who works with Gottman named Sybil Carrère, who was playing around with some of the videotapes, trying to design a new study, discovered that if they looked at only three minutes of a couple talking, they could still predict with fairly impressive accuracy who was going to get divorced and who was going to make it. The truth of a marriage can be understood in a much shorter time than anyone ever imagined. Gladwell, M. (2006)\nSome key findings from Gottman’s years of research can be summed up by his description of the “Four Horseman of the Apocolypse” - the signs that a relationship is in danger. In this interview he describes the signs and gives examples and demonstrates using video clips of couples:  https://youtu.be/625t8Rr9o6o\nRecall he began with a code book of twenty distinctive emotions that can be conveyed during a conversation. How difficult would it be for you to accurately differentiate between all 20 emotions using only the video clip? How did Gottman develop this system?\nA math major at MIT before he switched to psychology, Gottman developed a coding system that not only tracked the content of speech but the emotional messages that spouses send with minute changes in expressions, vocal tone, and body language. Using facial recognition systems, Gottman’s code accounts for the fact that, for instance, in “coy, playful, or flirtatious interactions,” the lips are often turned down. “It looks like the person is working hard not to smile,” he writes. Conversely, “many ‘smiles’ involve upturned corners of the mouth but are often indices of negative affect.” [ Dissecting Gottman’s Love Lab: Slate Magazine ]\nNote that in this case, “using facial recognition systems” does not refer to computer algorithms, rather just training grad students to watch hours and hours of interviews!\nGottman’s contribution was figuring out how to systemetize data collection about marital conflict. He may have ended up with 20 emotional constructs that were coded in all of the studies, but he no doubt started with dozens more ideas that were intractable to operationalize or not predictive of the outcomes. The list was eventually narrowed to 20, and time was spent on improving the coding protocols so data could be collected consistently.\nTo use the language of data science, Gottman went through a process of feature selection - identifying a set of meaningful variables that have the potential to predict the outcome of interest and looking for which are most useful. Loosely speaking, the more highly correlated a feature (variable) is with the outcome, the better a predictor it will be.\nPart 1 Questions:\n\nGottman’s lab records 15-minute videos of each couple, which sounds like a small amount of data relative to some of the other case studies we have examined this semester. How many data points are generated from those 15 minutes of footage, though? Stated differently, how many observations do the lab scientists record in each 15-minute interview?\nWhat is the measured outcome in the study described by Gladwell? How would that data be collected? And consequently how long did these studies take? Note that in machine learning jargon this would be called the “training dataset” since it includes outcomes that are used to train computer models which features are useful to accurately predict the outcome. The calibrated models can then be used to predict outcomes using data that does not include results.\nDo you think that a marriage counselor working with couples for 30 years would be able to accurately predict those that will get divorced after a 15-minute session 95 percent of the time, relying on intuition from practice alone? What was unique about Gottman’s approach that allowed him to achieve that kind of accuracy?\n\nPart 2: Predicting Home Values\nThe hard part of feature selection is that it’s always fairly easy to generate a large list of candidate variables, and often the only way to know which actually work is to test them all. It is typically hard to predict which variables might be more predictive before collecting data and testing them out.\nConsider the project to reduce harmful levels of binge drinking by youth in Iceland. To identify some key causes of binge drinking they developed literally hundreds of theories, and tested as many as they could. Some explanations were still unexpected:\nThe team has analyzed 99,000 questionnaires from places as far afield as the Faroe Islands, Malta and Romania—as well as South Korea and, very recently, Nairobi and Guinea-Bissau. Broadly, the results show that when it comes to teen substance use, the same protective and risk factors identified in Iceland apply everywhere. There are some differences: in one location (in a country “on the Baltic Sea”), participation in organized sport actually emerged as a risk factor. Further investigation revealed that this was because young ex-military men who were keen on muscle-building drugs, drinking and smoking were running the clubs. Here, then, was a well-defined, immediate, local problem that could be addressed.\nData scientists have grown very skilled at using data to predict home values before houses are listed for sale. Zillow’s median national error rate is under 4%, for example, meaning that more than half of their predictions about home values are within 4% of true selling prices. They are becoming so accurate that Zillow is experimenting with a new service of buying homes based upon their estimates and re-selling them on their platform without realtors ever being involved in order to bypass the painful process of spending 6 months in a house that is for sale.\nHow does Zillow do this? Which variables or features are the best predictors of home values? The variables (“features”) that Zillow uses in their model are reported below.

If we wanted to improve their models by adding new data, which features of homes and neighborhoods would you propose?\nPart 2 Questions:\nIn order to demonstrate what a feature selection exercise might look like, part 2 of this lab asks you to come up with one variable that predicts home value that is not included in the Zillow dataset.\nThe obvious features are already in the data - square footage, number of bedrooms, whether there is a garage and a pool, etc. You need to be a little creative to come up with another feature.\nNote that features in this case might be characteristics of houses themselves, but they also might be characteristics of neighborhoods or cities. These broader characteristics of the community, positive or negative, are baked into the selling price of the home.\nYou only need to think up one other variable that impacts home values. There are hundreds more. In order to verify whether your hunch was correct, you need to identify an academic article or peer-reviewed report that supports your claim. I suggest using Google Scholar, but many search engines work fine.\nFor example, I might hypothesize that high-end restaurants or coffee shops increase the value of homes. After a little searching I found this study: Measuring Gentrification: Using Yelp Data to Quantify Neighborhood Change. It finds that “changes in the local business landscape is a leading indicator of housing price changes. Each additional Starbucks that enters a zip code is associated with a 0.5% increase in housing prices.”\nAfter identifying the feature and an academic source to support its selection, write a paragraph about your predictor and how you think it will impact home values. Include a citation to the article that supports your claim. Combine your response with your answers to part 1 and submit them to iCollege to the Lab2 assignment folder by the due date.",

=======
    "text": "Overview\nIn the previous lab we examined the practice of feature selection - identifying the proper set of variables to use as inputs into a predictive model. Gottman developed a framework using 20 micro-expressions coded at one-second intervals. Iceland developed a set of variables that help predict whether teens are likely to abuse alcohol.\nA key pattern that emerges from the case studies and a take-away from Lab 2 is that identifying the proper data to include in a model is difficult. Typically, experts start with a large number of measures and eliminate variables as they are tested. It requires patience and attention to detail to identify the right set of variables for a given problem.\nThis week we will explore the process of “feature engineering,” the task of starting from raw data sources and “engineering” new variables by finding ways to code or extract new features. Feature engineering is common when using data like satellite imagery, document archives, or video. It is common that the data was not designed for the task at hand, but it contains rich information that is extremely valuable if it can be extracted.\nFeature engineering is also necessary because predictive models typically require quantitative variables, so data sources like images and text need to be transformed into counts and scales. “Engineering” can be simple or complex. A simple example is computing a new variable, BMI, from two existing ones (height and weight). More complex examples of what this process might look like for unstructured data are below.\nFor example, how can a computer read handwriting? It has to be able to translate easily from an image of hand-written text to some sort of mathematical abstraction of the sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt accomplishes this by isolating words, then isolating individual characters, then using a pixel grid to code which features exist on each character (vertical lines, curved lines, cross-bars, etc.), and making a prediction about which letter might be based upon specific features.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note, the elements above are concepts from typography that describe fonts, not a list of features from natural language processing, but you get the idea)\nWithout a set of features extracted from the raw image of a character, the computer can’t predict which letter it might be. In this way Lab 4 on Feature Engineering combines elements of Lab 2 on Measurement, and Lab 3 on Feature Selection. You “engineer” or “extract” a feature by first defining it (does the character possess a “bowl”), and then figuring out how the computer will observe or measure that feature.\nThe goal of this lab is to demonstrate a couple of processes of feature engineering from common machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. I would like you to develop an intuitive sense of how engineers approach the creative endeavor of turning raw data into meaningful quantitative measures. Some steps below show how raw data might be processed to make it interpretable (to code characters from text, you first need to isolate individual characters). Others steps show how raw data is translated into a quantitative variable that can be used as an input into a model.\nAs you read through the lab, think about the readings from Social Physics. How did computer scientists approach the task of understanding team performance in organizations? What sorts of data did they collect, and how did they generate quantitative measures from the raw data inputs of environmental sensors and employee smart badges? There are thousands of potential variables you could generate from human interactions in organizations, so how did they decide which measures were important? These themes will be revisited when we look at how Google tried to design the perfect team.\nWe start here with some basic examples of feature engineering in a few task domains.\nOptical Character Recognition\nThe process by which computer programs read handwriting or scan images of text is quite interesting because of how raw image files are converted into structured data. The process is broadly called Optical Character Recognition. short video\nFor these tasks the program must first take an image and identify the different units of text:\n\n\n\n\n\nThese can then be broken into the most basic component parts, characters. The actual predictive models that comprise programs reading text occur on a letter by letter basis, and the paragraphs are reconstructed after all letters are identified:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor these programs to work the computer must be able to effectively isolate each character:\n\n\n\n\n\nImages are a challenging data source because camera resolution, light sources, distance from the subject, and focus can all impact data quality. As a result, the first step in many applications that require computers to extract features from images is to process the image in a way that isolates the important information and standardizes some of the inputs.\nLet’s consider this basic program that allows you to take a picture of a graph, then will generate the underlying data for you. It does this by identifying the trend line, converting it to a pixel grid, then for each horizontal pixel measuring the vertical location of the trend line.\nInput image data can be messy, though. So first we need to standardize it to isolate the trend line.\nRaw image of a graph:\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Convert the colored picture to a grayscale version that emphasizes boundaries of graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Filter out any data that is below a threshold for opacity or darkness.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Convert to a negative view to maximize the contrast of the image.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of filters in this way is a common first step for models that use images as raw data sources. This will be true for self-driving vehicles that use cameras to collect data streams, or examples from the Digital Humanitarians text that use satellite images to predict the location of damage from a disaster. Next we will look at how these techniques are used to conduct a tree census.\nFor an interesting urban policy application of this approach, thanks to an program built by Microsoft you can now download a database of every single building in the United States that was built by an AI application that was taught to read satellite images.\nDoes anyone recognize this community?\n Trees\nTrees are important for cities, but maintaining a robust urban forest is expensive and challenging. “Trees clean the air and water, reduce stormwater floods, improve building energy use, and mitigate climate change, among other things. For every dollar invested in planting, cities see an average $2.25 return on their investment each year.” cite\nIf we want to decide where to plant trees in our city by bringing a data-driven approach to tree policy, we first need to measure the outcome. “How many trees are in your city? It might seem like a straightforward question, but finding the answer can be a monumental task. New York City’s 2015-2016 tree census, for example, took nearly two years (12,000 hours total) and more than 2,200 volunteers.” cite\nUsing high-resolution images that can capture a wide spectrum of light, data scientists have designed ways to use public data sources and AI to perform this task. Here is a high-resolution image of Washington DC that has eliminated all of the light except that reflecting off of green objects, i.e. plant life in the city (as opposed to buildings and parking lots):\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy enough, right? But wait! Green patches might be grass, shrubs, or flowers. How does the program know NOT to count these green patches as trees?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that trees reflect green light differently than other plants. If you apply the right filters you can further isolate the trees in the image from the rest of the plants. For example, watch the grass in the park disappear:\n\n\n\n\n\nOr eliminate all of the open green spaces in Boston (the grass at the airport is especially vivid):\n\n\n\n\n\nThese techniques allow us to isolate trees from everything else. But we now have another problem - a green island rarely contains a single tree. How can we isolate individual trees from a group of trees in a cluster?\nThe nice tutorial on tree canopy analysis offers some solutions.\nThe basic recipe for identifying trees within a cluster is to:\n1. Apply a Filter to isolate trees from other elements on the landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Detect Treetops using an algorithm that can predict the height of each pixel in the image.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step returns the geographic coordinates of each tree-top in the cluster so that you can see the tree through the forest.\nNote that Lidar uses lasers to enhance digital photographic techniques by including rich measures of light frequency and the ability to triangulate height. Lidar is an expensive technology, but many cities have a database of Lidar images that are open for public use.\n3. Model Canopies by using a geometric tesselation algorithm to predict canopy boundaries and create a new spatial file that contains both tree coordinates, heights, and canopy sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis information would be useful for tracking the number of trees as well as changes in canopies over time.\nFaces\nFacial recognition software has become accurate and ubiquitous. What features does a computer need in order to recognize a person? How are these features engineered from a two-dimensional image of a face?\nFeature Extraction\nSimilar to the programs that read text in images above by identifying text then isolating characters, facial recognition software starts by scanning an image to look for faces. If it finds one it then has a routine to frame the face, then isolate prominent features on the face:\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the hand-writing recognition example, we can apply filters to an image to accentuate specific features. With letters on paper we are trying to maximize the contrast between the ink and the page. With faces, different filters applied to images (or image processing algorithms) will highlight specific facial features.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce oriented to the face, an algorithm can identify facial landmarks (which is actually similar to how our own brains recognize faces):\n\n\n\n\n\nThe computer translates the landmark view of a small set of prominent features of a face to a grid model that measures the distance between each feature:\n\n\n\n\n\nVoila! We now have a format that can be used to generate quantitative variables describing a face. Each line represents a distance between facial landmarks. The length of each line becomes a distinct feature that can be measured and quantified.\nYou don’t always know the distance from the camera to the face, so you might not be able to predict the actual size of specific features (is my nose big or was the camera just way too close?), but it is easy enough to calculate relative sizes. If you set the distance between the eyes as a measure of one unit, for example, then every other distance on this graph (each line) can be calculated relative to that distance. Thus, you are not identifying individuals based upon the actual size of their noses, but by the relative distances between all features on their face.\nThere are different ways to accomplish this basic process of creating abstract mathematical models of the face. They all return a list of quantitative features that describe an individual face.\nAnd finally, we compare the measurements from a specific face against measurements in a large database of candidate faces. You can do this quickly because you are working with a few dozen measures (distance between eyes, distance between edges of the mouth, distance between edge of mouth to eye, etc.). You would calculate the difference between the face you are trying to identify, and each face in the database by comparing the length of each line.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the total distance between all of the features falls below a threshold, then the faces are flagged as a match to be examined further by a human, or some action is triggered (unlocking your phone or your front door, for example).\nFeature Selection\nAssuming that the photos are taken in good light with forward-facing subjects and decent resolution cameras, what do you anticipate being a challenge with this process? Facial feature landmarks might vary greatly based upon expressions (or angles of the camera):\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that some features, like distance between the eyes and size of the nose, will be static (i.e., reliable measures). Others, like the edges of the mouth or the size of lips, will be highly dependent upon the expression (i.e., low alpha if we think about facial features as latent constructs).\nStated another way, some features convey more information about the unique identity of an individual than others. The feature selection task is to identify which measures will contain the highest signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithms that match faces can also weight certain features more than others to account for expressions.\nThis paper explores the issue by examining which facial features contain the most information during the recognition task. They do this by examining which features, when changed, render the individual most unrecognizable.\n\n\n\n\n\nStated differently, if you omitted the high-salience features from your model like lip thickness, you would see a large drop in correct matches to the database. If you omit low-salience features like mouth size, you experience a lower impact on the accuracy of facial recognition.\nThis example is meant to give you an intuitive sense of what the computer algorithm might experience as features are “corrupted” in the images and remind you of the importance of the feature selection task.\nSo, if you are trying to escape the country by crossing a border, which feature would you try to disguise?\nLAB QUESTIONS\nPart 1: Letters\nAssume you have designed a program that can effectively isolate individual characters from an image of a license plate:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou now want to develop a machine learning model that will accurately identify each character, so you need to develop a set of features that describe the letters so the computer can begin to tell them apart.\nFor the lab, list three features of characters that could be reliably derived (“engineered”) from an image of a single letter and used as input data for a predictive model that can read a license plate accurately. Note that fonts used by states might vary, so letters and digits will not be identical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think this sounds challenging, recognize that there are hundreds of potential features (characteristics of the letter). Just look at how many terms hipsters have invented to lovingly diagram their favorite typefaces:\n\n\n\n\n\nOr spend five minutes with a hand-writing analyst.\nIt may be helpful for you to start by describing the difference between these letters to a child.\n\nYou might start by pondering how someone would distinguish the difference between a lowercase “o” and a lowercase “a”.\nHow would you describe the difference between a “1” and an “l”?\nBetween a zero “0” and an upper-case “O”?\nCapital “T” versus lower-case “t”?\n\nPart 2: Using Uniforms to Predict Job Title\nThe blog Toward Data Science describes an interesting machine learning application that predicts which category that an object or person belongs to based upon an image. They demonstrate the software by training it to guess people’s career based upon a picture of them at work:\nFor this tutorial, we have provided a dataset called IdenProf. IdenProf (Identifiable Professionals) is a dataset that contains 11,000 pictures of 10 different professionals that humans can see and recognize their jobs by their mode of dressing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are ten professions used in the example:\n\nChef\nDoctor\nEngineer\nFarmer\nFirefighter\nJudge\nMechanic\nPilot\nPolice\nWaiter\n\nThis dataset is split into 9000 pictures (900 pictures for each profession) to train the artificial intelligence model and 2000 pictures (200 pictures for each profession) to test the performance of the artificial intelligence model as it is training. IdenProf has been properly arranged and made ready for training your artificial intelligence model to recognize professionals by their mode of dressing. For reference purposes, if you are using your own image dataset, you must collect at least 500 pictures for each object or scene you want your artificial intelligence model to recognize.\nFor the lab, suggest three features of uniforms that might be used to classify images from a profession. Also include a rule statement about how the feature maps the specific profession.\nFor example:\nRule: If the uniform has stripes on the arms, Prediction the individual will be either a fire fighter or a pilot.\nSome more examples:\n\nIf the uniform includes a skirt the individual is not a farmer, mechanic, or chef (on the job).\nIf the uniform is mostly black, the individual will be a judge, pilot, or police officer.\nIf the uniform is mostly white, the individual will be a chef or a doctor.\nIf the uniform includes a bow tie, the individual will likely be a waiter (or an engineer?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Home Values\nWe have focused so far on feature engineering examples that use images as the input data, then extract features based upon models of letter style, tree structure, or the topology of faces. In these instances, we are translating from one data type (an image) to a traditional set of quantitative variables in a spreadsheet format (columns represents variables or features, and rows represent observations).\nIt is also common to engineer features from an existing dataset, to create new variables from existing variables. For example, population density is a common variable used in urban policy. This variable requires that you have a measure of the population of an administrative unit (number of people in a census tract) and the total geographic area of that unit. Density is then calculated as people per square mile (or whatever unit you use for area).\nPopulation density is often a more useful variable than the raw population because it tells you something about the average distance between individuals in a city. If you are opening a pizza delivery business, for example, the total population of the city does not matter if they are spread out over a large area. You will be more profitable serving a smaller population that is packed into a tight neighborhood than a large suburb which requires long delivery times and high operating costs. Stated differently, population density is a better predictor of the profitability of your new business.\nThe urban policy research group, Urban Spatial, offers a nice example of this in a model they created to predict gentrification of census tracts using historic census data.\nThey describe several features that they engineer for the model. Similar to other community change models we have examined, they measure characteristics of housing in census tracts to predict how each might change over time.\nOne thing they do differently from previous models, however, is use information about home value contagion. When home values rise in an adjacent census tract it increases the likelihood that home values rise in my census tract. This type of relationship is called a spatial correlation. This might occur because people that are looking to buy in a specific neighborhood might be priced out by rising costs in that neighborhood, so they instead purchase a home in an adjacent neighborhood. Higher demand from the spill-over will drive up prices.\nSimilarly, a drop in prices in a neighborhood can have a contagion effect if buyers looking at purchasing in an adjacent neighborhood get nervous about falling prices and look elsewhere, thus reducing the demand and lowering prices, resulting in a self-fulling prophesy in some instances.\nTo model these processes, you need to take into account information about neighboring communities. The paper Urban Spatial explains how they create (engineer) two variables (features) for their model.\nOne variable is created by calculating the average value of homes in all of the surrounding census tracts. Only those census tracts that are contiguous to your own (they share a border) are included. So, the census tract in the top left corner is excluded in the calculation, for example:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second variable was created after recognizing that the average value of surrounding homes might not be the best predictor of change. Rather, homeowners typically want to move into hot neighborhoods that have nice amenities and cool people. Since everyone wants to move there, though, these neighborhoods quickly become saturated and overpriced, and buyers spill over into nearby neighborhoods.\nThey identified all of the census tracts in the top 5th of the data (the top 20% of tracts based upon home values) and categorize them as highly-desirable tracts. They then calculate the distance from each tract in the dataset to the nearest highly-desirable tract:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are predicting home values for a tract in 2010, the value in 2000 will provide a reference point for where home values start but will not tell you much about whether you expect them to be rising or falling. The value of neighboring tracts, however, is a good predictor (if adjacent tracts have more expensive homes, prices are likely to rise, if they have cheaper homes, prices will likely fall). And the distance to the closest “hot” neighborhood in 2000 will provide a different type of information about possible trends. The two variables that explain trends are both second-order variables that are created from the raw census data.\nFor the Lab: recall that in the previous lab you were required to identify a neighborhood or metropolitan feature that impacts home values (for example, every time a Starbucks opens in a new neighborhood home values increase by 0.5%).\nUsing the feature that you identified in Lab 2 (or another you may need to choose), explain how you would “engineer” it by answering the following questions. You are NOT allowed to use a metric that is already an existing census variable and requires no engineering (i.e., calculation).\n1. What is your unit of analysis? Census tract, zip code, city, etc.\nSome variables are better at a very local scale (crimes tend to impact prices on surrounding blocks but not much further), whereas others are only meaningful at a metro or regional scale (i.e., activity of regional airports).\n2. What type of data do you need to calculate the variable?\nWhat measures are included in your formula? For example, if a new Starbucks impacts home values, you would measure the distance to it for each home. You would need a database of Starbucks in your city with their locations.\n3. What is the process or formula you would follow to create the variable?\nWrite out instructions for calculating your metric in a way that a data engineer could implement. For example, to calculate the distance to the nearest Starbucks:\n\nIdentify the location of each home in the dataset.\nIdentify the nearest Starbucks.\nCalculate the distance between the two points.\n\nNote! These instructions are not specific enough because you can easily calculate the Euclidian distance between two points on a map with a formula, but how often do you travel in a straight line to a destination? Maybe a travel distance time derived from Google maps might be a better metric? Or maybe travel time, rather than distance? Are you assuming people are walking, driving, or taking public transit?\n4. How reliable will your measure be?\nUsing your knowledge about instrument development, do you feel like your new variable will accurately reflect the true underlying latent construct you are trying to measure? For example, using the programs described in the lab, I could fairly accurately measure the total tree canopy cover for a specific neighborhood (the average is about 20% coverage in most cities). If I were trying to create a hipster scale to measure how cool a neighborhood is by identifying how many local menus include craft beer, my scale might be less reliable (largely because craft beer is mainstream, not cool enough).\nLooking Ahead\nThe goal behind the design of the last three labs was (1) to encourage you to think about how the data that we use every day and that has a big impact on our lives is created, and (2) to demystify machine learning and artificial intelligence. These exercises were designed to give you insight into the black box of predictive analytics, remote sensors, and artificial intelligence.\nYou do not need to know how to build a car from scratch to be a good driver. Similarly, you do not need to be a data scientist to incorporate these new tools into your future career. Your job as a future analyst or manager, for example, may be to determine whether automation or a predictive model would add value to your organization. If so, you can hire an expert to build the models for you.\nThat said, a little bit of vocabulary will help you write a call for proposals, interview potential firms, and manage the process along the way. The processes of feature selection and measurement can be challenging for an outside expert that doesn’t intimately understand your program. You can add a lot of value by collaborating with the experts during the process to identify latent constructs, select features that are important to the question at hand, and discussing how the data may need to be engineered for analysis and/or modeling.",

If you’re undecided at this point in the semester what question you’ll propose to answer, describe ones that cluster around the same topic for this assignment.\nFor example, I’m interested in understanding the relationship between needle aversion and COVID vaccination rates. I think that the language and imagery used to encourage vaccination is having the opposite effect. Nearly every advertisement or news segment about COVID vaccination shows a needle going in an arm (up close!) and uses language like “get the shot” or “jab,” which evokes negative feelings in most people (e.g., like going to the dentist or booster shots as a child). For those who also have fears that the vaccination is risky, these images and words reduce the likelihood that they’ll get a vaccine. I hypothesize that the ubiquity and volume of this imagery on TV and social media (big data) is reinforcing needle aversion to an extent that it’s driving down vaccination rates. So, my research question is “Has intense exposure to imagery and language of needles decreased COVID vaccination rates in the United States?” If a relationship exists, removing needle imagery and language from mass media could improve vaccination compliance and lower the threat of COVID to public health."

As an asynchronous class at the graduate level, my expectations for their quality are high.\n\n\n\nLabs (20%)\n\nThe course includes four labs that ask you to think critically about big data and its characteristics. The labs are largely non-technical.\nYou are expected to complete all four labs by their due dates. Each lab is worth 5% of your final grade.\n\n\n\nData Certification (20%)\n\nAppreciation of big data includes knowing how to use it. Although this isn’t a technical course, you are required to build competency in data tools that fit your interests and need for future work.\nYou will curate a series of five data courses via GSU’s Research Data Services or an online learning platform to earn a data certification. Ideally these courses help you to develop the big data project proposal that is the final assessment for this course.\nYou must complete all five data courses to earn a certification and credit for this assessment.\n\n\n\nBig Data Project Proposal (30%)\n\nThroughout the course you will use the data science process to design a big data project of interest to you. It will start with asking an interesting question and culminate in developing a model using big data to answer the question.\nAs you’ll learn, big data projects are tedious and take time to conduct responsibly. This assessment asks you to design a project, not implement it.\nAs a proposal, you will design the big data project in stages throughout the semester as we cover them in class. Most of the stages will be shared with the class through online discussion posts for peer and instructor feedback.\nYou will complete a proposal of at least five pages, which is worth 30% of your final grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Assignments\n\nNo unexcused late assignments will be accepted without penalty. All deadlines will be posted on iCollege.\nIf you anticipate missing assignment deadline due to a university approved reason, please write me an email ASAP. Excused absences/missed work include legal obligations (jury duty, military orders); religious obligation; death or illness of a student’s immediate family; and illness that is too severe or contagious to attend class/do classwork. All excused absences require written documentation from an authoritative source verifying the absence by date and reason.\n\n\n\nWithdrawal Policy\n\nLast day to withdraw from this class is February 28, 20xx.\nStudents who withdraw after the midpoint of each term will not be eligible for a “W” except in cases of Emergency Withdrawal.\nImportant University dates can be found at https://registrar.gsu.edu/registration/semester-calendars-exam-schedules/\n\n\n\nPolicy on Academic Honesty\n\nReview GSU’s policy about cheating, plagiarism, and the repercussions if you do not operate with academic honesty. Note: Lack of knowledge of this policy is not an acceptable defense to any charge of academic dishonesty.\n\n\n\nStudent Code of Conduct\n\nReview the following at the link to the Student Code of Conduct:\n\nStudent Rights and Obligations\nGeneral Conduct Policies and Procedures\nAcademic Conduct Policies and Procedures\nAdministrative Policies"

Nearly every advertisement or news segment about COVID vaccination shows a needle going in an arm (up close!) and uses language like “get the shot” or “jab,” which evokes negative feelings in most people (e.g., like going to the dentist or booster shots as a child). For those who also have fears that the vaccination is risky, these images and words reduce the likelihood that they’ll get a vaccine. I hypothesize that the ubiquity and volume of this imagery on TV and social media (big data) is reinforcing needle aversion to an extent that it’s driving down vaccination rates. So, my research question is “Has intense exposure to imagery and language of needles decreased COVID vaccination rates in the United States?” If a relationship exists, removing needle imagery and language from mass media could improve vaccination compliance and lower the threat of COVID to public health."

This assignment requires that you identify a research question and develop a plan to complete workshops over the semester that will expose you to the data science knowledge and skills needed to develop a big data project. By the end of the semester, you’ll submit a proposal that describes how you can answer the research question using big data and data science techniques.\nYou may be a novice to big data terms and sources at this point in the semester, but you probably have questions in your field that can be explored with data. For example, you may be interested in pollution levels of major cities and what conditions lead to poor air quality days. While structured data like measures of ozone levels, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides can be used to identify poor air quality, big data generated from the sources of pollutants can be used to predict poor air quality days.  Vehicles, traffic lights, navigation apps, satellites, etc. generate high velocity, high volume, and unstructured data that can be harnessed to predict poor air quality days. With these data, you can explore questions like, “What impact could limiting semi-trucks driving on I-75 between 6am and 6pm have on air quality in Atlanta?” The purpose of the data certification is to learn about the types of big data and analysis techniques needed to answer the question that you formulate from your field of interest.\nFormulating a good research question takes time and is iterative as you learn about types of data and techniques. This exercise gets you started on crafting a question and finding tutorials that can help you develop a project plan to answer it. It requires that you identify five, 90 minute tutorials that can tailor your learning about big data to answer the research question that you develop. To complete the assignment for this week:\n\nRead the instructions for the data certification plan.\nIf you need some inspiration, Google “big data and X (your field).” It’s also a good idea to look at some academic journals in your field to see how the techniques of data science are being applied.\nWrite me an email or set up a time to talk if you need help.\nSubmit your data certification plan to corresponding assignment folder.\n\nDue by: 9/3 at 11:59pm",

The labs are non-technical, but they do require you to consider the origins of data, how they perform as measures of individual/social constructs, and how data scientists make choices about data to use in their models and the effects of those choices.\nThis lab introduces you to two data-driven models of neighborhood change. We will use this case study over the semester to discuss things like data needs for predictive models. You will be required to think critically about the data used in the labs, but you will not be responsible for things like the advanced analytical models in the paper. I am approaching the labs with the assumption that you are likely to be new analysts or a manager hiring an analyst, so you just need a high-level understanding of the models in order to participate in the task.\nTo prepare for the lab, you should read these two report (**note the page numbers assigned**):\n\nGoldstein, I. Market Value Analysis: A Data-Based Approach to Understanding Urban Housing Markets in Board of Governors, Federal Reserve Systems, Putting Data to Work: Data-Driven Approaches to Strengthening Neighborhoods. 2011. pp 49-59\n\nDelmelle, E. C. (2017). Differentiating pathways of neighborhood change in 50 US metropolitan areas. Environment and planning A, 49(10), 2402-2424.\n\nRead the instructions for Lab 1 and post your answers to the questions posed in the lab to the 2.2 Lab 1 assignment folder.\nDue by: 9/21 11:59pm EST",

This week’s readings introduce you to open data that may be available for your project. Through the readings, you may learn about new repositories or sources of data for your project, including those made available through formal research.\nThis week you’re also being exposed to a very important part of a data project - exploratory data analysis (EDA). The blog by Bourke (2019) describes the key steps in exploratory data analysis that you’ll need to consider as you determine the focus and feasibility of your big data project. Although you won’t be responsible for manipulating or analyzing data for your project, you do need to know where you’ll get it (source), its type, structure, and features.",

It asks you to consider the quality and types of data that are used in research and measurement. Lab 2 is due on Thursday, 9/28.\nThe second task is to read the instructions for your big data project and begin compiling existing research on the topic you’ve chosen. Reading peer-reviewed articles in academic journals or think tank reports can help you identify big data sources and how they’ve been used to explore your topic. The data and methods sections of research articles/reports should detail the source, type, structure, and variables used in the study, which will give you insight into data that you can use for your research question. You should compile this research into an annotated bibliography that you’ll use for the literature review in your big data project proposal. The annotated bibliography should include 7 - 10 works on your research topic that you’ll annotate and share with a peer discussion group. This discussion post will be due on Sunday, 10/1.\n\nDue by: Lab 2 - 9/28 11:59 pm EST; Discussion Post 3.3 - 10/1 11:59 pm EST.",

Sometimes data as “features” nicely fit the construct that needs to be measured (e.g., height as measured in inches or cm). Other times, the data must be converted to a form that can be useful for prediction. For example, when you’re trying to use digital data to predict images that contain cats, the machine needs to know what features to look for to distinguish a cat from a dog. This lab pulls back the curtain on how these processes are engineered with digital data to give you insights into how machines “learn” to predict X. The lab is largely instructional; however, as you learn about these processes, consider how they influence the output of machine learning and how they can introduce errors.\nDue by: 10/8 at 11:59pm EST",
